Use `'gdb'` with `sheldon1`.<br>
As now, we know the specific function to be disassembled. In this case its `phase_2`. <br>
So, create a breack point in `phase_2` by using `b` and run the program ud=sing `r`. <br>
Provide the previous level's passphrase and hit enter. As for the next one we know that it required 6 numbers so, for this moment just enter ` 1 2 3 4 5 6` and hit enter, the breakpoint will be created.<br>
